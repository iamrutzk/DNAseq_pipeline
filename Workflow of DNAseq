# Workflow of DNA sequencing 

1. Raw Data in “Fastq” format
2. Quality Check using “Fastqc”
3. Mapping Genes on Reference Genome using “Bwa” tool
4. SAM tools to convert into BAM file
5. Sorted BAM file
6. Remove the duplicates using “Picard-tools”
7. Mutation or Variant calling using “GATK” program
8. GATK “Haplotype-Caller”(Germline) and GATK “Mutect2”(Somatic)
9. Functional prediction of genetic variants using “SnpEff or SnpSift”
10. Convert it into VCF format
11. Filter the mutation based on Depth and Mapping quality
12. Final variation and Annotation using Ensembl (web based)
13. Variation Visualization “Using IGV”
14. Data Interpretation using “Breakdancer”

Final report is based on potential mutation strains, which are non-synonyms and causing the disease.
